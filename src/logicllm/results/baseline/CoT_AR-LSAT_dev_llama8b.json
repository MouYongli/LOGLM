    "answer": "B",
    "predicted_reasoning": "Since Fred must be assigned to locker 3 and Trisha is also assigned to locker 3, it means that only one child can be assigned to locker 3. Given that Marc alone is assigned to locker 1, Juan cannot share a locker with Rachel as she cannot share a locker. Therefore, Juan must be assigned to locker 4 or locker 5. If Juan were assigned to locker 2, Paul would have no other option but to be assigned to locker 4, which means Nita and Trisha's lockers would not be adjacent, violating the condition.

Therefore, Paul will occupy locker 2 (as it's the only available option). Since Nita's locker cannot be adjacent to Trisha's, Nita will not be in lockers 1 or 5. The only remaining option is Nita in locker 4. This means Juan must share a locker with Rachel. As Rachel cannot share a locker, this means Rachel and Juan are assigned to locker 2 (with Paul).

Since used pop is on sale, we can conclude that at least one type of CD is being sold. Now, let's analyze the conditions: If both types of pop are on sale, then all soul is. This implies that if both types of pop are not on sale, then some soul must be. Similarly, if both types of jazz are on sale, then no rap is. Since we don't know which type of CD is being sold, let's assume the minimum possible scenario where only one type of new CD is on sale. This would mean that at least one used CD (pop) and one new CD (jazz or opera) are being sold. Now, considering the condition 'If neither type of jazz is on sale, then new pop is.', we can conclude that if no rap is on sale, then some soul must be. Since only one new CD is being sold, it cannot be both a new jazz and a new opera (as they would require different sale conditions).

Since none of the options mention both jazz and rap being on sale, this condition does not help us narrow down the correct option. The condition 'If either type of rap is on sale, then no soul is' implies that if at least one rap CD is on sale, it cannot be true that any soul CD is also on sale. Since none of the options mention both rap and soul being on sale, this condition does not help us narrow down the correct option. Therefore, we analyze the conditions related to used pop CDs. We know that used pop CDs are on sale. The condition 'If both types of pop are on sale, then all soul is' implies that if both used and new pop CDs are on sale, it must be true that all soul CDs are also on sale. Since none of the options mention all soul CDs being on sale, this condition does not help us narrow down the correct option. The final condition states 'If neither type of jazz is on sale, then new pop is'. This means that if used and both types of jazz CDs are not on sale, it must be true that new pop CDs are on sale. We can rule out options D and E since they do not mention any of the conditions related to jazz or rap being on sale.

If it's not, then Sales would be toured on both consecutive days (Monday and Tuesday) or Production would be toured on Tuesday, which is not allowed. Therefore, if Monday's tour is different from Tuesday's, it means Operations was toured on Monday. Now, we know that the division toured on Monday cannot also be toured on Friday. If it were, then Sales would have been toured on both consecutive days (Thursday and Friday), but it can only be toured on two consecutive days.

Similarly, since Zhu serves on a different committee from the one on which Wharton serves, then Zhu must serve on the finance committee. Now consider Lepp serving on the finance committee: this implies Miyauchi and Upchurch both serve on the incentives committee. But Guzman cannot be on the same committee as Upchurch, so Guzman must serve on the finance committee. Therefore, only one member (Hawking) can serve on the incentives committee, which means that Zhu is the other member who serves on the finance committee. Finally, since Hawking cannot be on the finance committee with Zhu, then Hawking must serve on the incentives committee alone, and Guzman and Zhu both serve on the finance committee. This leaves only two spots remaining for Miyauchi and Lepp to fill. Given that Lepp serves on the finance committee implies Miyauchi and Upchurch both serve on the incentives committee, which is already full, Lepp must serve on the incentives committee as well.

    "predicted_reasoning": "Since no more than three subzones can be designated for each of the three uses (housing, industrial, and retail), we know that at most two subzones are left for housing. Since one subzone is already designated for housing in Z2, the remaining housing subzone must be in either Z1 or Z3. If it were in Z1, then no more than one subzone would remain for housing in Z2 and Z3 combined, but since there is already one subzone in Z2, this means that there would not be enough room to designate any housing subzones in both Z2 and Z3. Therefore, the remaining housing subzone must be in Z3. This leaves no more than two subzones for retail use overall, so at most one subzone can be designated for retail use in each of Z1 and Z2. Since there are already three subzones designated for retail use (one in Z1 and two in Z2), this means that Z3 cannot have any subzones designated for retail use. This also implies that Z3 must have at least one industrial subzone, as it cannot have a housing or retail subzone.

    "answer": "D",
    "predicted_reasoning": "Since Flynn must be on desk duty earlier in the week than Hill and Kitson, we can deduce that Flynn cannot be on desk duty later than Wednesday. Therefore, Flynn's desk duty day must be either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. If Flynn is on desk duty earlier in the week than Hill, then Hill's desk duty day must be Thursday or Friday. Similarly, since Moore must be on desk duty earlier in the week than Gomez, Moore cannot be on desk duty later than Wednesday. Therefore, Moore's desk duty day must be either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. If Flynn is on desk duty earlier in the week than Hill, then we can also deduce that Kitson must be on desk duty earlier in the week than Zahn because of the constraint 'Kitson must be on desk duty earlier in the week than Zahn'. Finally, since Leung's desk duty day cannot be later than Flynn's and Flynn is on desk duty earlier in the week than Hill, Leung must also be on desk duty earlier in the week than Hill. Therefore, we can conclude that if Flynn is on desk duty earlier in the week than Hill, then Moore must be on desk duty earlier in the week than Zahn (because Kitson's day is already determined).",

This constraint affects Monday and Tuesday. Hill must be on desk duty earlier in the week than Leung. Both Hill and Moore must be on desk duty earlier in the week than Gomez. Kitson must be on desk duty earlier in the week than Zahn. Therefore, we can deduce that Flynn will be on desk duty either Monday or Tuesday, not later in the week. This means options A, B, C and E are all viable. However, if we substitute the constraint with option D - Flynn must be on desk duty earlier in the week than both Gomez and Kitson - this would still have the same effect as the original constraint, as it also restricts Flynn from being on desk duty later in the week.",

Larson is assigned to the same area as either Koguchi or Mendez but not to the same area as both. Jefferson's assignment depends on Olsen's assignment, but since Olsen is alone in area 2, Jefferson can be assigned anywhere except area 2, which means Jefferson cannot be assigned with Koguchi. Therefore, Jefferson and Pruitt could be assigned together with Mendez. Hence, option C (Mendez, Pruitt) could be the complete assignment of rangers to area 3.",

Yi and Zane must both be assigned to Pricing if either one of them is, so let's assign both of them to Pricing first. Now we have three assistants left (Smith, Taj, and Vogel) who need to be assigned to a course. Since Markets already has two assistants, the only option left is Labor.

However, if T transmitted the virus to Q, we know that either T or U transmitted the virus to P. Since only two computers can transmit the virus to more than one other computer on the network, and S already transmitted the virus to another computer (R), it's likely that U transmitted the virus to P.

As there are only six computers, we consider all possible scenarios: If it's not P, then either T or U must be infected from outside.
