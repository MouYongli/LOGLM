    "predicted_reasoning": "The rabbit sees the cat. If someone sees the cat and they are not green then they see the cow. Since the rabbit is round (given context), it does not fit this condition, so it must be green. This means that the rabbit also sees the cow. The squirrel eats the rabbit. Rough people are cold. If someone eats the squirrel then they are rough. So, the squirrel needs the rabbit and the squirrel is cold. Since the squirrel sees the cat, the squirrel needs the cat too. If someone needs the squirrel and it is not green then they need the squirrel. So, the squirrel must be green. This means that the squirrel does not see the cow. The cat eats the squirrel, so the cat is rough. Rough people are cold. Therefore, the cat is cold. Since the cat sees the squirrel, the cat is cold and the cat is rough. The question asks if the cat is not round. Since the cat is cold and rough, it must be round (as it fits this condition).",
