    "predicted_reasoning": "If Rock is cute and still, then it can be a rabbit because all rabbits are cute. However, since Rock is still, it cannot be a squirrel as all squirrels are skittish and if something is skittish, then it is not still. Therefore, Rock must be a rabbit or not an animal at all, but there's no information about other animals being still except for Rock. Given the options of either a rabbit or a squirrel, Rock cannot be a squirrel as explained before, so it has to be a rabbit if it were an animal. However, given that all squirrels are skittish and Rock is not skittish (since it's still), then Rock cannot be a squirrel but could be a turtle since some turtles exist and there's no information about their characteristics. There is also the possibility of Rock being neither a rabbit nor a turtle because an animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel, and Rock does not fit into these categories as established before. However, if we consider that all animals are either rabbits or squirrels, then Rock must be one of them since it's still and cannot be skittish. But since Rock being cute could imply it being a rabbit (as all rabbits are cute) but is still which means not a squirrel, there is no direct relation established between Rock being cute and still and being a turtle, nor can we establish that Rock must be a turtle from the given premises as turtles' characteristics aren't described. Since there's an implication of Rock possibly being a rabbit due to it being cute and since its stillness does not align with the squirrel characteristic of being skittish but also there's no direct information that links Rock's cuteness and stillness directly to it being a turtle, we must consider if it can be a turtle based on the available premises. The statement says 'If Rock is cute and still, then Rock is a turtle and skittish,' which would mean if Rock has these two characteristics (cute and still), then it should have the other two (be a turtle and skittish). Given that being cute could make Rock a rabbit but there's no information about turtles or any relation of cuteness to them, we can't establish this connection directly. Moreover, since Rock is not skittish as established before because it is still, then saying Rock would be skittish if it were cute and still contradicts the information given (all squirrels are skittish, and something that's still cannot be skittish). Since there's a possibility of Rock being a rabbit due to its cuteness but no direct relation of cuteness or stillness to turtles nor any information about turtles' characteristics that would align with Rock's observed traits and the statement implies an outcome (Rock is a turtle and skittish) which contradicts established facts from given premises, then this makes the entire implication uncertain because there are not enough details about other animals like turtles and their behaviors or characteristics to support the claim made in the statement directly.",

This means that a design by Max cannot be both a mass product design and timeless at the same time. Since all of Kelly Wearstler's design styles are dreamy, if a design by Max is a mass product design then it would have to be Kelly Wearstler's style which also has to be evocative.

    "answer": "B",
    "predicted_reasoning": "First, we need to determine if a design by Max is timeless. The given statement 'If a design by Max is timeless, then a design by Max is a mass product design and evocative.' indicates that if a design by Max is indeed timeless, it will also be both a mass product design and evocative.However, the initial statement 'No mass product design is timeless' contradicts this, as it asserts that no mass product design can be timeless. This means we have to rely on other information to determine the nature of Max's designs.Since there's no direct connection between Max's designs and being dreamy, and given Kelly Wearstler's designs are both evocative and dreamy, but not necessarily related to Max's style directly, we can't conclude a design by Max is definitely dreamy based on the information provided.The question asks if a design by Max is either evocative or dreamy. We know from the statement about Kelly Wearstler that her designs are both evocative and dreamy, but there's no direct link to Max's style being one of these without more specific connections in the context.Since we cannot make a definitive connection between Max's design style and either being evocative or dreamy directly from the given information, we have to consider if it could potentially fit either description based on what is provided. However, given that there's no explicit link of Max's designs to Kelly's (which are both evocative and dreamy), or a clear indication that his design must be one of these two based on the other statements, we cannot confirm with certainty.Therefore, without a direct connection in the information provided, it's uncertain if a design by Max would fit either description given. The lack of explicit links to being evocative or dreamy specifically for Max leaves the question open.",

Let's break it down and analyze the given information. All female tennis players at Roland Garros 20 lost to Iga Świątek. Either female tennis players at Roland Garros 20 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 20. This implies that Coco Gauff must be either a female tennis player who lost to Iga Świątek or a male tennis player. If Coco Gauff is a female tennis player, then she lost to Iga Świątek. However, the statement says 'Coco Gauff is not a player who lost to Iga Świątek.' This means that Coco Gauff cannot be a female tennis player who lost to Iga Świątek. Therefore, Coco Gauff must be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 20. If a player is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are among the most active players in major tennis. Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association. This means that only female tennis players can be ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association and be among the most active players in major tennis.

If people need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition, then they order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes. People either order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes. Therefore, Mary orders takeout frequently in college or enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes. If people enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. However, there is no information about Mary's preferences on food being picky or not. Therefore, if Mary is a picky eater, we cannot be certain that she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. But if she is not a picky eater, then it means that she enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, and hence she does spend a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.",

    "answer": "A",
    "predicted_reasoning": "Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home. If people spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes, then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon. Therefore, Remy does not spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon. If people work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly, then either Remy visits the office supply store regularly or they does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon. From above statements we can see that if Remy visits the office supply store regularly, it means that they work regularly and often at home. If people work regularly and often at home spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes. But from above statements we also know that if Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon then they spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, this is contradictory to what we get when Remy visits the office supply store regularly. Therefore Remy neither spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home nor has a fully stocked and impressive home office if either goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon or visits the office supply store regularly.",

Also, all severe cancers are deadly diseases, and bile duct cancer is a severe cancer. Additionally, all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. We can also infer from the information that no one with mild flu has a low survival rate.Now let's look at the conditions for colorectal cancer - if it's a bile duct cancer and its survival rate is low, then it is not a bile duct cancer. Since all Cholangiocarcinoma are bile duct cancers, if colorectal cancer were to be both a bile duct cancer and a Cholangiocarcinoma, the condition would be contradictory as we already established that bile duct cancers (including those with low survival rates) aren't supposed to exist according to the statement.However, there's no information that directly correlates colorectal cancer being a mild flu. Mild flus are not considered deadly diseases and do not have low survival rates; they're mutually exclusive from the categories of severe cancers or bile duct cancers.Hence, the statement that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then it's a bile duct cancer and a mild flu - cannot be logically supported based on the information given.",

However, if it's given that colorectal cancer is not a mild flu (which does not have a low survival rate) and a Cholangiocarcinoma (all of which are bile duct cancers), we can infer that since it must either be a bile duct cancer or have a low survival rate but cannot both be its own type of cancer and another, then being a Cholangiocarcinoma makes it also a bile duct cancer by definition.

It is either both true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents. Since it's one of the two statements being true, if she did grow up in a health-conscious childhood home then she must have a good relationship with her parents and thus fulfills her nutritional daily intakes. If she didn't grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she doesn't have a good relationship with her parents but still fulfills her nutritional daily intakes because the other condition to fulfill them is visiting the gym at least once a day which isn't connected to having grown up in a health-conscious childhood home or not. Therefore, regardless of whether Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home or not, she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes.

From the given information, if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. This statement tells us that if KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, then it must be either terricolous or have legs. However, we just found out that if KiKi is terricolous, then it jumps. Therefore, the condition of KiKi neither jumping nor having legs can only happen when KiKi has legs, but this contradicts our assumption of KiKi not having legs. So, this statement actually tells us that KiKi must jump or have legs. If an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. Since we know KiKi either jumps or has legs, and if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps, we can conclude that KiKi definitely jumps. However, there is no direct information about KiKi being terricolous. The condition for KiKi to be terricolous was never met in the reasoning above.",

    "predicted_reasoning": "KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. All dogs are animals that bark and have legs (since they jump). Therefore, KiKi cannot be a dog because it does not have legs.",

    "question": "Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? KiKi neither barks nor is a dog.",
    "answer": "A",
    "predicted_reasoning": "All dogs are animals that bark. If an animal barks, then Jane does not like it. This implies that if Jane likes an animal, the animal cannot be a dog. The statement KiKi neither barks nor is a dog can only be evaluated as true or false based on the information provided. Since there's no direct information linking KiKi to either being a dog or not, we look at other properties. If an animal has legs, then it jumps. If an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. This means that if Jane does not like an animal, the animal cannot jump. From this information alone, we still cannot determine whether KiKi is a dog or not since there's no direct link to barking for KiKi. However, given the initial statement about dogs and animals that bark, and considering all other options imply some form of movement (jumping) which would make Jane like an animal, we deduce indirectly by eliminating other choices that do not directly involve being a dog or barking but are tied to Jane's preferences that there is insufficient information to conclusively label KiKi as either barking or a dog based on Jane's liking. Yet, the statement seems to aim at linking dislike with certain characteristics (barking) which dogs have and are thus liked by Jane if they do not bark. Since all premises lead to circular reasoning without directly connecting KiKi to any action of barking or being a dog but through the lens of Jane’s preferences, we consider what is known about animals and Jane's behavior towards them and realize that we cannot confirm if KiKi does either based on provided statements. However, this complex web of relationships doesn't provide clear evidence one way or the other directly from the information given. Therefore, without a clear link to either condition (barking or being a dog) for KiKi, but understanding the context is trying to establish preferences and characteristics, we deduce that based on the premises, there isn't enough direct information about KiKi's behavior or classification as a dog. Given this analysis seems circular and does not directly answer from the options provided without making an assumption, re-evaluation shows that the structure of questions might suggest looking for a characteristic not explicitly stated but implied through elimination which is a common logical fallacy in such structured problems.",
