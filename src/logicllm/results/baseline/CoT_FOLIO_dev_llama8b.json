If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she attends and is very engaged with school events. Therefore, Bonnie must be a student who attends the school.

If Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the WTA or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Since Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA (everyone who lost to Iga Świątek is ranked highly by the WTA), and she is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 (if she was, she would have lost to Rafael Nadal), then Coco Gauff has lost to someone else.

    "predicted_reasoning": "Dani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets. Since Dani Shapiro is an American writer and wrote a novel called Family History, we can conclude that she is not only a novelist but also a podcaster. Therefore, it is logical to assume that she is a novel writer.",

However, we know that Dani Shapiro is an American writer, so she must be a novelist if she wrote a novel like 'Family History'. Therefore, Dani Shapiro can create both novels and podcasts.
