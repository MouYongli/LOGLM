Please provide the next step, which I assume will be asking me to answer the questions in the format of constants, predicates, premises, and query.\n\nFrom the examples provided earlier, I understand that:\n\n1. The grammar for first-order logic formulas is defined as follows:\n    * Logical conjunction: expr1 ∧ expr2\n    * Logical disjunction: expr1 ∨ expr2\n    * Logical exclusive disjunction: expr1 ⊕ expr2\n    * Logical negation: ¬expr1\n    * Implication: expr1 → expr2\n    * Bi-implication: expr1 ↔ expr2\n    * Universal quantification: ∀x\n    * Existential quantification: ∃x\n\n2. The rules for predicate naming are as follows:\n    * Predicate names have to be extracted from the verbal phrase of each sentence, starting with the main verb followed by the adverb in the form MainVerb_adverb.\n    * If some verbs have no corresponding adverbs, then only give the verb name in the list.\n    * Never use negations like \"not\" in any combination.\n    * If there is an expression without a verb, use the full adjective phrase to form a combination in the form Is_adjective_phrase.\n    * If the verb is \"am\", \"is\", \"are\", \"was\", or \"were\", then take the full adjective phrase of the sentence instead of the adverb and take \"is\" instead of the main verb in the form is_adjective_phrase.\n    * Never use predicates as infix operators (e.g., x predicate y).\n    * Never use embedded predicates (e.g., predicate_one(predicate_two(x)) or predicate_one(predicate_two(x), predicate_three(x))).\n    * Never use the same predicate with different numbers of arguments (e.g., plays(x) and plays(x, y)).\n\n3. The rules for constants and variables naming are as follows:\n    * All variables have to be a character from the set of characters {u, v, w, x, y, z}.\n    * The priority order of using the variables is: x, y, z, u, v, w.\n    * Never use the same name for both constants and predicates in the first-order logic formulas.\n\nPlease provide the next step, which I assume will be asking me to answer the questions in the format of constants, predicates, premises, and query."

People either regularly drink coffee or joke about being addicted to caffeine. No one who jokes about being addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug. Rina is either a student and unaware that caffeine is a drug, or neither a student nor unaware that caffeine is a drug.

Based on the premises, we can conclude that if Rina is not dependent on caffeine and a student, then she must be unaware that caffeine is a drug (or joke about it). Therefore, the query is **TRUE**.\n\n**Example 2**\n\nProblem: Miroslav Venhoda was a Czech choral conductor who specialized in the performance of Renaissance and Baroque music. Any choral conductor is a musician. Some musicians love music.

Based on the premises, we can conclude that since any choral conductor is a musician, and Miroslav is a choral conductor, then he must be a musician. Moreover, some musicians love music. Therefore, we can infer that Miroslav, being a musician, loves music. Therefore, the query is **TRUE**.\n\n**Example 3**\n\nProblem: Natural language processing tasks can be categorized as either language generation task or language understanding task.
